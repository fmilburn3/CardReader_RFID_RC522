# CardReader_RFID_RC522
Library and example for TI MSP430 LaunchPads and Energia that reads a card number using a RC522 MIFARE module, takes action depending on the card number, and prints it to the serial monitor.

Tested with Energia V16 on the following LaunchPads:

          MSP-EXP430G2553 LaunchPad
          MSP-EXP430F5529 LaunchPad
          MSP-EXP430FR5969 LaunchPad
          CC3200 LaunchPad

Tested with Energia V17 on the following LaunchPads:

          MSP-EXPF5529 LaunchPad
          MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad - does not work
